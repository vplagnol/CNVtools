\title{Copy Number Variant intensity data}
\description{
Dummmy simulated data set. Will eventually contain a CNV from WTCCC data but awaiting authorization. 
%This data set contains copy number intensities from SNP loci within a CNV. There are two control cohorts from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium study. 
}
\usage{data(A112)}
%\format{A dataframe containing a row per individual (2593 in total) and 35 columns. The first two columns contain subject name and cohort membership.
%The remaining columns contain the copy number intensities for each locus within the CNV. This CNV contains 33 SNPs.}
